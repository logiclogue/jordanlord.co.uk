Uni Fantasy Cup is a 129 team simulated football knock-out tournament that posts
results to Twitter in real time. It uses the [Football Score
Simulator](/projects/football-score-sim) that I developed. Each of the teams
represent a university. The strength of each team is based on the [Complete
University Guide's university league
tables](https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings).
