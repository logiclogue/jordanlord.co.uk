A few birthdays back, I received the [MightyOhm Geiger Counter kit](http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/). One thing that was always frustrating was how it didn't have a display.

That was the goal of this project, to add a display to the MightyOhm Geiger
Counter.

The goal was to try and get the pulsed output, from the board, to a display.
Arduinos are readily available cheaply and easily programmable. So this was the
solution I went for. Initially, I prototyped it with the full Arduino board.
Once complete, I soldered it onto a protoboard.
