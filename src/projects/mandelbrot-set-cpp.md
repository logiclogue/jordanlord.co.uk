title: Mandelbrot Set Generator
draft
---

## Goals

- To practice C++
- To practice coding that follows the SOLID principles
- To create interfaces that are used for swapping, for example, the Mandelbrot
  Set for a Julia Set. There will also be an interface for drawers. There will
  be an implementation of `Drawer` that will draw to the console and another
  that will draw to a PNG.
- Draw the Mandelbrot Set as plain text.
- Draw the Mandelbrot Set as a PNG using `libpng`.
