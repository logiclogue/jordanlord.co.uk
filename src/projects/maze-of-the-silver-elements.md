title: Maze of the Silver Elements
---

This is Maze of the Silver Elements, a 3D maze game for the web.  The mazes get
increasingly bigger as you progress through the game. To progress to the next
maze you must collect a silver element.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the game to the standard I would've liked.
Due to studying for exams, time and mental energy was cut short.  The next Ludum
Dare I'm hoping to be fully ready and give it a real go.

I have really enjoyed taking part in Ludum Dare 35, it has been a fantastic
learning experience as I have not used Three.JS before.  It was really
satisfying implementing depth-first search to generate the maze.
