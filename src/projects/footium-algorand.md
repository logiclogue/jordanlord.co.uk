title: Footium (Algorand)
---

Following on from the Footium Project, the team entered the Algorand Club
pre-accelerator. The Algorand Club is designed to take projects from the
prototype/working demo stage to start-up stage.

As part of the project, we updated Footium to work on the Algorand platform.

We are now looking to launch the application in February as a fully fledged
project and business. In the next month we are going to do our first Alpha
launch.
