Footium is a football simulated game based on the Ethereum blockchain. I lead a
team of three as part of the Spark Hackathon to develop the game in 8 weeks. Out
of over 100+ teams, we reached the finals of the hackathon.

In the game, each club and player is an NFT token that can be traded on the
Ethereum blockchain through the Footium smart contract. To facilitate the
multiplayer aspect, the games are simulated in real-time. The match result,
match events, as well as player attributes are simulated as part of an off-chain
game engine. The off-chain game engine is purely functional and deterministic so
that the game state can be regenerated on every player's machine independently.
The player interacts with the front-end React site.

The project is currently receiving funding to be redeveloped for the Algorand
platform.
