Sheepdog Dino is a game developed in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 33. Ludum Dare is a
game jam where you have 48 or 72 hours to develop a game based on a theme. The
theme for this Ludum Dare was 'you are the monster'. This made me choose a
dinosaur as the main character.

In the game, you control a dinosaur that must save all the humans. Humans are
frightened of you, so you must use this to your advantage to chase them to the
exit. The game play is very much like herding sheep, hence the name 'Sheepdog
Dino'.

The game was written in JavaScript on top of a simple game engine that I wrote.
The HTML5 canvas is used for rendering.
