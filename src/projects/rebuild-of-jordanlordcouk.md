title: Rebuild of jordanlord.co.uk
---

The main goal of rebuilding my website was to make it better represent me. To
achieve this, I decided to give it a terminal/editor kind of look.

I also wasn't satisfied with the old site being Angular driven. Having
JavaScript disabled meant you wouldn't be able to visit the site. Instead, a
totally different approach was taken. The approach was to make this site a
static website. The framework of choice was Metalsmith since it is lightweight,
modular, and is written in NodeJS.
