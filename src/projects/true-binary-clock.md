True Binary Clock is a
[web app](http://jordanlord.co.uk/binary_clock)
and native
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jordanlorddevelopments.binaryclock).
I first programmed it in JavaScript and then ported it to Java for the Android
version.

## Update

In August of 2016, I updated the web version. This version is now available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/logiclogue/true-binary-clock-web). The only
difference between the original and the updated version is how it's coded. I've
rebuilt it to be much more modular.
