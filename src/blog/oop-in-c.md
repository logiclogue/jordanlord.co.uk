title: Object-oriented Programming in C
draft
---

Implementing object-oriented programming in C is a fantastic way to understand
how object-oriented code works at the low level. Of course C++ exists to solve
this very problem. However, C++ has its own problems. Top programming, [such as
Linus Torvalds](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus), have spoken out
about how C++ is a "horrible language". It's easy to fall into the argument of
whether C++ is an incredibly powerful programming language, or whether it leads
to bad code. Quite frankly, I'm not qualified to say. The whole point of this
article is to demonstrate object-orientated programming in C. So we will avoid
the flame wars, for now.

## Objects

Objects are the key data structure in object-oriented programming.

## Conclusion

Lots of boiler plate required.
