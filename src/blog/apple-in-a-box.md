## Introduction

My goal with this article is to outline a way of thinking fundamentally about
the universe using reversible cellular automata.

I am not an academic or scientist, I am a found, CTO, and software engineer,
this article is just my own thoughts. I don't claim to have invented any of the
ideas here, nor do I have citations. This article is purely an exercise of
formalising my own thoughts on reversible cellular automata.

The universe is strange, it is worth exploring every way of thinking about it.
These thoughts came about through my interest in cellular automata, but more
recently through an interest in on-chain blockchain games. I was thinking about
how you could generate a world that was only explorable through locality (e.g.
actually travelling to the place). It turns out, it is only possible to build
this kind of world through either a proof of work or lottery generation. I will
revisit these ideas later in the article.

Think of this article as a thought experiment. The universe that we will
conceive is a REVCAR universe (REVersible Cellular Automata with interesting
Rules). The thought experiment assumes that the second law of thermodynamics
gives rise to the most fundamental laws and behaviours within the universe.

## Reversible Cellular Automata

Reversible cellular automata are a type of cellular automata where the same
rule applies both forward and backward. Most cellular automata that we are
familiar with only have rules that apply forwards not backwards, Conway's Game
of Life is a good example.

The second law of thermodynamics is implied by having a reversible rule-set.
This means we can reason about entropy in the same way as we do about entropy of
real world systems.

You'll start with a low state of entropy, as the simulation goes on, entropy
tends to increase.

The REVCAR universe will be a reversible cellular automata.

## The Problem with the Game of Life

The Game of Life is a type of cellular automata that was created by
mathematician John Horton Conway. The Game of Life is probably the most well
known cellular automata. The problem with it is that entropy tends to decrease
as the simulation progresses. This is due to the rule only applying forwards and
not backwards. This is fun for creating complexity and interesting structures
that emulate the behaviour of life.

However, in our case it is not going to be useful for trying to think about how
fundamental constructs and behaviours in the universe emerge from the second law
of thermodynamics.

## Machines

In our REVCAR universe, we can start thinking about the concept of a "machine".
Here we will define a machine as a repetitive structure over many iterations. In
order to build a machine in a reversible cellular automata, it is either all
encompassing or it "breaks down". To give some examples of what can be
classified as a machine: a human, bicycle, star, atom.

In the simplest form, you could think of a simple convection current gradient as
the most basic "machine".

In the Game of Life, machines are often perpetual repeating structures. A glider
gun is perhaps the best example. A glider gun does not obey the second law of
thermodynamics, therefore we aren't interested in these types of constructions
for the sake of this thought experiment.

I'm going to introduce the idea here of the "environment dependence hypothesis".
This is the idea that a machine is defined in terms of its environment, and it
is only created within the context of its environment. A bicycle, for example,
is not useful in space. In addition, a bicycle does not spontaneously form in
space. Instead, a bicycle is only useful within a confident environment, such as
roads, where there are humans that will utilise them for the purpose of leisure
or transport. This is quite a complex definition, its creation is a result of
billions of years of evolution and thousands of years of human progress and
development.

Therefore, for our universe to be interesting, we want to see machines which
work in their native environment and are created inside of an environment.

## Apple in a Box

The "apple in a box" is a thought experiment, whereby if you have an apple in a
perfectly closed box and wait an infinite amount of time, the apple will reform
in the future into its exact same state, you may have to wait a quadrillion
years. This is the exact same behaviour as you'd observe in REVCAR. If you
deployed a machine, you could forward the state N number of times until the
machine magically reformed back into itself.

Although this thought experiment is interesting, it is not at all helpful. This
is because you'd have to wait an unreasonable amount of time before you see the
apple form again.

What is more interesting is running the rules in reverse. What came before the
apple? What created it?

## Anti-matter

Anti-matter plays an important role in our idea of the universe. In the
observable universe, we notice that anti-matter is often created spontaneously
through the creation of particle and anti-particle pairs (quantum foam). This
type of particle anti-particle pair creation is constantly happening, with these
particles instantly annihilating. This is deeply connected with the idea of
black holes evaporating and obeying the 2nd law. However, it is also important
in our reversible cellular automata to explain "user input".

In order to have a concious external user provide input to our universe, while
also remaining reversible, particle anti-particle pairs are necessary. Let's
assume you write your name into our reversible cellular automata at iteration n.
You would expect iteration n - 1 to deterministically be an empty universe.
However, this is not the case in a typical reversible cellular automata
construction. Our construction must satisfy the property that at iteration n -
1, the drawn name must be the empty universe. The only way to achieve this is by
every input being the creation of a state anti-state pair.

The implications of this assumption is that it helps us better understand how
black holes and space time work within this simulation.

- TODO - quantum foam is defined by user input!

## Black Holes

Now knowing REVCAR has quantum foam, we can start to reason about black holes. A
black hole is a region of space time where the curvature of space time is so
large that anything that crosses the black hole's "event horizon" has a single
destination, the singularity.

In the observable universe, the only information that escapes a black hole is
via the gravitational affect on quantum foam, preventing the particle
anti-particle pairs from annihilating each other. This property must hold in
REVCAR for us to be able to identify a black hole.

A black hole is machine within REVCAR where the only information about the
creation of the machine (things that fell into it) are radiated by the
interaction with quantum foam. In addition, it is a region of the cellular
automata where things can only fall into it, not escape.

This begs the philosophical question about our observable universe, what if the
quantum foam was completely still? What if there was no user input? In this
model, the black hole would not radiate any information. Is the universe making
a promise that at some point in the future, a particle anti-particle pair would
fall into the black hole? Without an observer, is the universe stale?

## Space an Time

Based on our conclusions of the black hole hypothesis, space and time is
emergent from the rules of our reversible cellular automata. Space is not
defined by the lattice of the universe. The core lattice of REVCAR can be
thought of as just that, the core lattice. Higher order structures are emergent.
Space time is an emergent property.

## Exploration

- TODO - holographic principle and how that ties with on-chain blockchain games

## Holographic Principle

## The Big Bang

By virtue of the reversible nature of reversible cellular automata, we can
reverse the simulation and find out what created our supposed machine. The
"name" construction would spontaneously form from the coaleasing of gas and
dust. However, I'm here to argue that machines never form from gas and dust.
Instead, they form from a series of long running processes. If we forward back
in time, we should see the birth of the universe.

- TODO - below is not written well, "powerful idea"

There's a subtle powerful idea here that closely ties with assembly theory which
shows that it is in fact impossible to build a machine manually inside a
reversible cellular automata. There are only a few universes that exist which do
so, they must be found at random.

## Garden of Eden Patterns

In all non-reversible cellular automata, there are states which are known as
"Garden of Eden Patterns". These are patterns which do not have a preceeding
state. The very nature of reversible cellular automata is that no Garden of Eden
Patterns could possibly exist.

- TODO - what is this? How does it tie with reversible cellular automata

## Misc
