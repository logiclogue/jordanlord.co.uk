## Introduction

My goal with this article is to outline a way of thinking fundamentally about
the universe using reversible cellular automata.

I am not an academic or scientist, I am a found, CTO, and software engineer,
this article is just my own thoughts. I don't claim to have invented any of the
ideas here, nor do I have citations. This article is purely an exercise of
formalising my own thoughts on reversible cellular automata.

The universe is strange, it is worth exploring every way of thinking about it.
These thoughts came about through my interest in cellular automata, but more
recently through an interest in on-chain blockchain games. I was thinking about
how you could generate a world that was only explorable through locality (e.g.
actually travelling to the place). It turns out, it is only possible to build
this kind of world through either a proof of work or lottery generation. I will
revisit these ideas later in the article.

## Reversible Cellular Automata

Reversible cellular automata are a type of cellular automata where the same
rule applies both forward and backward. Most cellular automata that we are
familiar with only have rules that apply forwards not backwards, Conway's Game
of Life is a good example of this.

The second law of thermodynamics is implied by having a reversible rule-set.
This means we can reason about entropy in the same way as we do about entropy of
real world systems.

You'll start with a low state of entropy, as the simulation goes on, entropy
tends to increase.

## The Problem with the Game of Life

The Game of Life is a type of cellular automata that was created by
mathematician John Horton Conway. The Game of Life is probably the most well
known cellular automata. The problem with it is that entropy tends to decrease
as the simulation progresses. This is due to the rule only applying forwards and
not backwards. As a result it is not useful for thinking about life or the
universe, as it does not emulate the fundamental reality that we observe.

## Machines

Once you have a reversible cellular automata, you can start thinking about the
concept of a "machine". Here we will define a machine as a repetitive structure
within our cellular automata. In order to build a machine in a reversible
cellular automata, it is either all encompassing or it "breaks down". This later
property makes it very interesting to think about.

- environment dependence hypothesis

In traditional cellular automata, a machine more commonly perpetual, meaning
that it repeats itself forever.

## Apple in a Box

The "apple in a box" is a thought experiment, whereby if you have an apple in a
perfectly closed box and wait an infinite amount of time, the apple will reform
in the future into its exact same state, you may have to wait a quadrillion
years. This is the exact same behaviour as you'd observe in a reversible
cellular automata. If you deployed a machine into a reversible cellular
automata, you could forward the state N number of times until the machine
magically reformed back into itself.

Although this thought experiment is interesting, it is not at all helpful. This
is because you'd have to wait an unreasonable amount of time before you see the
apple form again.

What is more interesting is running the rules in reverse. What came before the
apple? What created it?

## Anti-matter

Anti-matter plays an important role in our idea of the universe. In the
observable universe, we notice that anti-matter is often created spontaneously
through the creation of particle and anti-particle pairs (quantum foam). This
type of particle anti-particle pair creation is constantly happening, with these
particles instantly annhiliating. This is deeply connected with the idea of
black holes evaporating and obeying the 2nd law. However, it is also important
in our reversible cellular automata to explain "user input".

In order to have a concious external user provide input to our universe, while
also remaining reversible, particle anti-particle pairs are necessary. Let's
assume you write your name into our reversible cellular automata at iteration n.
You would expect iteration n - 1 to deterministically be an empty universe.
However, this is not the case in a typical reversible cellular automata
construction. Our construction must satisfy the property that at iteration n -
1, the drawn name must be the empty universe. The only way to achieve this is by
every input being the creation of a state anti-state pair.

The implications of this assumption is that it helps us better understand how
black holes and space time work within this simulation.

## Black Holes

Working with our anti-matter hypothesis for our reversible cellular automata, we
can start to reason about black holes. A black hole is a region of space time
where the curvature of space time is so large that anything that crosses the
black hole's "event horizon" has a single destination, the singularity.

In the observable universe, the only information that escapes a black hole is
via the gravitational affect on quantum foam, preventing the particle
anti-particle pairs from annihilating each other. This property must hold in our
reversible cellular automata.

A black hole is machine within our reversible cellular automata where the only
information about the creation of the machine (things that fell into it) are
radiated by our state foam. In addition, it is a region of the cellular automata
where things can only fall into it, not escape. Without user input (state foam),
the internal state of the black hole is running on a different system of rules.

This begs the philosophical question about our observable universe, what if the
quantum foam was completely still? What if there was no creation of particle
anti-particle pairs? In this model, the black hole would not radiate any
information. Is the universe making a promise that at some point in the future,
a particle anti-particle pair would fall into the black hole?

## Space an Time

Based on our conclusions of the black hole hypothesis, space and time is
emergent from the rules of our reversible cellular automata. Space is not
defined by the lattice of the universe.

## Exploration

- TODO - holographic principle and how that ties with on-chain blockchain games

## Holographic Principle

## The Big Bang

By virtue of the reversible nature of reversible cellular automata, we can
reverse the simulation and find out what created our supposed machine. The
"name" construction would spontaneously form from the coaleasing of gas and
dust. However, I'm here to argue that machines never form from gas and dust.
Instead, they form from a series of long running processes. If we forward back
in time, we should see the birth of the universe.

There's a subtle powerful idea here that closely ties with assembly theory which
shows that it is in fact impossible to build a machine manually inside a
reversible cellular automata. There are only a few universes that exist which do
so, they must be found at random.
