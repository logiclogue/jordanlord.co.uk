title: Time Task Tax Method

I'm trying a new time management technique this week. Let's call it the 'time
task tax method' (TTT). The principle is similar to how goods are taxed, but
with time and effort. Often when we execute a task, like cooking or writing
code, we fail to 'clean up' after ourselves. The universe dictates that the
arrow of entropy moves from low to high, from order to disorder. If we cook, the
kitchen gets dirty. If we write code, the codebase gets messier.

This principle dictates that every time a task is carried out, time must be
allocated to cleaning up, or 'paying tax'. The tax is used to move the arrow of
entropy in the other direction. To keep the kitchen clean, to refine your
strategy.

The principle dictates that 'paying tax' is time-boxed and factored into the
task at hand. Improving the code strategy is factored into a pomodoro after a
series of 7 pomodoros executing the task.

If we fail to do this, like crumbling infrastructure, later we must pay for an
expensive rebuild. We have to create a task to clean the kitchen, we have to
create a task to refactor the codebase.

Of course, there are many counter examples where this does not work. My
experiment is to see how this can be applied to even those most minute tasks. My
theory is that successful individuals and organisations already execute type of
this principle. Without it being a clearly stated principle, it is part of their
operational principles, it is part of their attitude.
